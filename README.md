# Video Game Boxed Sale Trends from 1980 to 2012

My name is Kayleigh Soukup. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my abilities with different tools used for data analytics, such as Jupyter Notebook/Pandas, SQL, DTale, Excel, and Tableau. Please note that I intentionally planned and implemented this analysis to use a wider variety of tools to showcase my experience than I might use in a real world application. I am currently seeking a position as a data analyst. If you would like to contact me about possible opportunities, please email [kayleigh.soukup@gmail.com](mailto:kayleigh.soukup@gmail.com).

The main data used in this analysis is a list of video games sold as physical copies, sorted by name and publisher. Some games appear multiple times as they are released in different platforms. In order to fit the criteria to be added to this dataset, the game had to have sold at least 100,000 copies. There were 14,413 total rows, with 10,347 distinct video game titles, covering the years 1980 to 2012. The data shows the rise of boxed sales revenue peaking in 2010 as the video game industry matured as well as the negative impact on boxed sales that mobile gaming and digital downloads had on the physical sales market.
